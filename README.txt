project used to play with and learn HTML5/CSS3/MVC3 (Fixed Layout)

-------------------------------Notes-------------------------------------

I have taken a sample CSS3/HTML5 template (see main web page for details) as a starting point and started restructuring from there
to redesign as a MVC3 app.  See project documentation for further details.  

Note The original solution I built implemented an inverted architecture (Domain at root, DAl injected in) but I have changed to a more DDD
orientated model.
